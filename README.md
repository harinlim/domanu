# Domanu

Domanu is an online hub of marketplaces that allows user to enter into commitment-based transactional relationships to give or receive services.
This website is designed to increase connectivity in consumerism and give users a way to buy and sell goods with the knowledge that they can rely on the opposite party.

This app is built with a React frontend and Python backend that integrates with Supabase to handle storage and authentication.
